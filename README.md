# F21CA-Games3: Minecraft Murder Mystery with LLM-Driven NPCs

This project presents a fully voice-interactive murder mystery game built inside **Minecraft**, featuring **LLM-powered NPCs**, immersive narrative design, and real-time dialogue. Players interact naturally with NPCs to investigate a murder case aboard a luxury cruise ship and deduce the true culprit.

## Project Highlights

- **Minecraft + AI Integration**  
  Built on **Minecraft Fabric 1.20.4** with Java 17 using the **CreatureChat mod**, this game transforms traditional gameplay into a fully voice-enabled mystery-solving experience.

- **LLM-Driven NPCs**  
  Each suspect is powered by **OpenAI GPT-4o**, configured with prompt engineering techniques including:
  - Chain-of-thought reasoning
  - Role-playing persona prompts
  - Counterfactual misleading
  - Unreliable narration (for the culprit)

- **Voice Interaction Pipeline**
  - **ASR (Speech-to-Text):** Microsoft Dictation for real-time transcription
  - **LLM Querying:** Azure OpenAI API for context-aware NPC responses
  - **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** Baidu TTS API for dynamic, emotional voice playback

- **Narrative Design & Gameplay**
  - Explore the cruise ship
  - Discover hidden clues
  - Interrogate suspicious characters
  - Track achievements and identify the murderer!

- **Evaluation**
  - Improved LLM accuracy, relevance, and emotional consistency to **100%**
  - 80% player success rate in identifying the correct suspect
  - User testing, questionnaires, and safety optimization included
